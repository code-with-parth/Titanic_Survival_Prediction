# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository explores the challenge of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the historical Titanic dataset, this project aims to build and evaluate models that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking.
